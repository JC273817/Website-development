<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Karan Lakhanpal <br>
<strong>Login:</strong> JC273817 </p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p> CossiePlay is based out of Hulkstown. Our business is focused on combining costume and fashion accessories with fun. What we aim to do is to raise the level of promoting cosplay as a piece of art and entertainment.We are doing this by providing quality workmanship and variety of outfits for generation X to Z. 
</p>
<p>Cossieplay's Mission is to help people conduct fun, interesting and meaningful activities! OR in 4words, "Supporting Your Cosplay Experience!"
</p>
<p> Lastly, we aim to sell our costumes and fashion accessories at the best pricing possible in Hulkstown.
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The main reason to go online is bring ourselves closer to younger audience those who like to do Cosplay and express their passion for themes and characters but think of it as an expensive affair.</p>
<p> We will consider ourselves successful if we are able to generate 2-5 new customers visiting our store every week and be able to double our current estimate of making 4 costumes per week to atleast 8.
</p>
<p> The criterion to evaluate this investment (Yes! Having a website is an investment indeed) is to see atleast 50 people joining us to monthly party in first six months of going online and hitting atleast double the number in first two years.
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p> We intend to reach out to teenagers and people from both genders that are in the age group of 13-25.</p>
<p> Website will not be the only online medium to go closer to our audience. We will be actively promoting our business on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Offering discounts in return of recommendations, referrals, likes/shares on our facebook page will be a good way to thank our customers and get to know new ones.</p>
