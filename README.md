# Website-development
To develop website as assignment task 1 for CP5638
Task Guideline
This assignment involves two parts, to be implemented as Web pages and submitted as described
below.
1. Project Plan
2. Small Website
Due: 5pm Friday Week 5
Your (fictional) client for the assignment has provided a Word document containing a description
of their goals and some text content, as well as a number of images and an Excel spreadsheet with
more content for the site (see the zip file attached).
Your task is to turn this into a clear useful plan and a small functional website.
Project Plan:
Write your project plan so that it is a useful working document to guide your development.
Carefully consider the description provided by the client to inform your planning.
Complete the plan by editing the plan.html template file provided, which contains the following
required sections:
Goals
Concisely state what the goal (purpose) of the website is. Note that the mission must be to
improve something in a measurable way. To "provide information about something" is not a
good mission, since you can't see a measurable improvement. Why is the site needed? How
does it benefit the client? Be clear and specific. Good mission statements are usually only a
few sentences and contain no unnecessary information.
Success Evaluation
Describe the process(es) by which the site's success will be evaluated. Note that "hits" only
counts people (or robots) visiting your website, which says nothing about whether the site
has achieved its mission. How do you know that the site does what the client wanted?
Measure the mission you stated above.
Target Audience
Describe two things clearly and specifically:
1. the target audience that your site is intended for (be specific; you can't aim for
everyone)
2. how you will intentionally design the site to cater to this group (as distinct from
another, different target audience).
Site Flowchart
Create a site flowchart to show the hierarchy of pages in the site and their relationships.
Each page should be represented by one box.
The order of boxes is the order these links should appear on the site.
If you don't have a preferred drawing program for flowcharts, use www.draw.io.
Save your flowchart as a PNG file (normally the best file format for plain, straight-lined
diagrams like this) and insert the image in your plan file under this heading.
plan.html is the template file provided for your documentation, which you must use.
Do not change the file name or the formatting.
CP5638 – Assignment 1 IT@JCU 1/4
Do not edit it in Word - just save it and edit it as an HTML file (in Dreamweaver, PHPStorm, etc.)
Each section has a heading and a spot (…) for its content.
Add your name in the <title> before submitting.
Your plan needs to be uploaded as plan.html to the server (do not change the file name).
The plan should not be linked to from your website.
There is no set word limit for your plan, but be clear, concise and complete.
The lecture on planning will be helpful in your planning process.
Small Website:
Design and develop a website for the client. Use your project planning (goal, target audience,
flowchart) to inform and guide your design.
 Use all of the text content provided by the client, including the spreadsheet data (but not
the description about goals that they have provided for you, the developer).
 Use some or all of the images as appropriate. You may NOT use ANY images other than
what you have been provided with and what you create yourself (but don’t take new
photos).
You can edit the images and develop logos, banners, buttons, etc. (in Photoshop) from
scratch or using the provided images as a starting point.
 Edit the text and image content, which comes “as is” from the client, to make it suitable for
the website. You are welcome and encouraged to write small amounts of additional text to
benefit the site, as appropriate. But don’t just make stuff up that might not be true.
 Think about the information architecture (organisation) and decide what content should
go on what pages to best achieve the site goals.
 You must develop the site from scratch yourself. You may NOT use existing templates.
Although it is up to you exactly what goes in the site and how/where, you should have at least the
following elements:
 HTML Pages - name your home page file index.html
 Navigation - links between pages and to the external sites provided (no broken links).
 CSS - you should normally use an external style sheet for most/all styling.
 Images - make appropriate use of the images provided for your site.
(Consider editing, resizing, cropping, compression, etc.)
Version Control
Use GitHub to store your work as you develop your plan and site. Keep it up to date by
committing changes with descriptive commit messages. You will need to use GitHub for your
group project, so start practising with this individual assignment.
Submission:
1. Submit a zip file of your work to LearnJCU.
2. Upload both the website (with all required files) and plan.html (with flowchart image file) to
the Subject Web server into a folder called a1 inside your jcxxxxxx folder.
See Steps_to_work_with_subject_servers_2017.pptx for uploading files/folders to your remote
jcxxxxxx folder.
Important! You absolutely must meet this requirement. If your site is in a folder called A1 or
anything other than instructed, we will mark only your plan on LearnJCU, not the website.
If you do not submit the zip file to LearnJCU then you will receive zero marks. Check it!
